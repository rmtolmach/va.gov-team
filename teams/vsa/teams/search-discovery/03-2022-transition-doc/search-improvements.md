## Feature background


Search on VA.gov uses the Search Results API provided by Search.gov. The help manual can be found [here](http://search.digitalgov.gov/manual/).

In order to get access to the search.gov console, you have to have a log in and be approved. This process is best accomplished by emailing [[search@gsa.gov](mailto:search@gsa.gov "mailto:search@gsa.gov")](mailto:[search@gsa.gov](mailto:search@gsa.gov "mailto:search@gsa.gov")). *When you do so, be sure to CC your PO as part of the process, as they track VA approval for all credentialed accounts they distribute.*
