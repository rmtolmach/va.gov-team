## Product context 
 - Problem Statement: Veteran data is a mess at the VA. Itâ€™s kept in hundreds of databases, and any given department or medical center may have access to different pieces of information. This makes it hard to understand the full picture of what the VA knows about any given Veteran/person.
 - [VA Profile vs. VA.gov Profile](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/README.md#is-va-profile-the-same-thing-as-the-vagov-profile)

It follows the standard issue outline, but already has the team name in the title and automatically adds some of the tags.
  - [Template .md file](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/auth_profile_issue.md) - Edit this file if changes to *Authorized Experience Profile New Issue Template* are needed.
