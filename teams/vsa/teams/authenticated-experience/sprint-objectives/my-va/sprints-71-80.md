## Sprint 71 (4/6 - 4/19) 

- If applicable: Add Columbus, OH to list of Cerner facilities #38551

### General

- Say goodbye to Heather :(
- Welcome back AJ :) #39292

### Payment info

- Updates from staging review, if necessary
- Privacy and security review (ticket open and pending review)
- If all is good to go, recruit and hold UAT #38194
- PM: During UAT, make sure we can see analytics coming in for new links #39280
  - [Use this report](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/report/content-event-pages/a50123418w177519031p176188361/explorer-table.plotKeys=%5B%5D&_r.drilldown=analytics.pagePath:www.va.gov~2Fmy-va~2F,analytics.eventCategory:Interactions) and make sure you see [all new links for which we've added tracking](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/37589).
  - You'll need to filter the report to add between 100 - 250 results, since the new links will only have been clicked a handful of times during UAT.
  - Success: We see data coming in for all new links.
  - Only do this if we hold UAT this sprint

### On-site notifications

**PM**

- VANotify to start work; evaluate what they need to do so we can plan our own timelines
- Do we have a plan for QA? How are we going to trigger a notification for testing? #34543

**Design**

- Explore notification style so we don't have to use the alert/error styling #39090

**Medical co-pays/debts**

- TBD. Need to figure out if we need more explorations or if we have designs ready for testing.

### My VA audit

**Design**

- Audit health care #39050
- Audit benefit payments and debts #39051
