## What to know about the product 
- va.gov/find-locations
- It is VA's single source of truth for Veterans and beneficiaries to find VA facilities and location details about all VA facilities, across VHA, VBA, and NCA
- It is the newer version of VA's old facility locator: <https://www.va.gov/directory/guide/home.asp>
- Previously powered by the non-public-facing Vets API for VA facilities
- Now powered by the public-facing [Lighthouse Facilities API](https://developer.va.gov/explore/facilities) for VA facilities
- It uses Mapbox for maps functionality: <https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/> (which was changed to an annual license version, effective Oct 1, 2019, facilitated by Nancy Smith of Oddball)
- It serves many purposes, from finding basic facility address and phone information to preparing for a visit, to understanding eligiblity for community care

### Other notes

- Facility Locator 1.0 work can be found in this old repo: <https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/facilities/facility-locator>

  <summary> Design problems </summary> 

    - Users don't have a way to get to urgent care facilities
  - See the following research study documentation:
    1. Main research repo: <https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/community-care/urgent-care/research>
    2. Research readout: <https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/community-care/urgent-care/research/jun-2019/findings.md>
    3. User flows Mural board: <https://app.mural.co/t/adhocvetsgov9623/m/adhocvetsgov9623/1560946920965/4bb321f266f232e3e1d91559b168a0f3c11fe84f>
- Search UI is inconsistent (i.e., free text search box, dropdowns, typeahead)
- Community care "facilities" are actually providers, so users are searching for persons, not places
- Facility API data often does not load or show up on facility detail pages
- Web browser's location/geo-location functionality doesn't always work (or work well) on facility search page

## What to research
- Pain points and bright spots with the current product (i.e., evaluative usability testing)
- Users' mental models for VA facilities and services, including community care
  - Specifically, how users think about in-network emergency care, urgency care, and urgent care pharmacy facilities
- How to integrate services and facilities into the UX (i.e., search by condition or service needed vs. facility type)
- How/if we should integrate content editing/publishing of some facility detail page content using the Drupal CMS
  - Images! Should we use Drupal to manage facility images for each facility detail page?
- Creating facility detail page URLs and content that are SEO (i.e., /wilmington-vet-center vs. /vba456)
- How to include drive-time functionality into UX
- How to make the product work faster for users
- How to better architect how we call data from the community care database
- All the data sources! How can we better streamline our data sources, and structured product content on the UI, so users get a consistent product experience
