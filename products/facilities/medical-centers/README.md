## Legacy info about the VAMC pages

## VAMC upgrade work - October 1, 2020 thru December 31, 2020

**Product owner:** Dave Conlon (David.Conlon@va.gov), DEPO
**Business stakeholder:** Jenny Heiland-Luedtke (Jennifer.Heiland-Luedtke@va.gov) VHA Digital Media 

### Business goal
`By end of October 15th, 2021, VAMC will have all Systems in dual-state status.`

**What this means:**
- All 139 VAMC systems will either be in full production or in dual-state status. 
  - (Dual-state status, is where the CMS system has been published and is visible via a browser using the approved VA URL, but is not yet customer facing due to disallow blocking set up in robot.txt files) 
  - All new required site content is drafted and published in Drupal Prod (prod.cms.va.gov)
  - All legacy content, files, links, etc. have been accounted for and documented (upgraded or not)
  - The team has created and documented (e.g., upgrade runbook, content creation cheatsheets, step-by-step guides, etc.) a repeatable, scalable VAMC site upgrade process in order for VHA to be able to upgrade 134 legacy VAMC system websites over a 24-month period

**What this does not mean:**
- VAMC public affairs teams are trained on Drupal
- Each VAMC has reviewed and finalized their new website's content and information
- We have turned off the old websites and implemented site redirects
