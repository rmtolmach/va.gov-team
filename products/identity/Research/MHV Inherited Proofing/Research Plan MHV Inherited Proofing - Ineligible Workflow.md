# Research Plan for [Identity, MHV Interited Proofing, Ineligible 3/2/21]

## Background

This research is for the Office of the CTO - Digital Experience (OCTODE) - Identity Team Leads for VA.gov. This research is being informed by moderated (August), unmoderated (October), and moderated (December) studies that were conducted in 2021. The three studies focused on the Veteran sign-in experience on VA.gov, specifically changes to the sign-in modal. With this research, the Identity team hopes to understand the user experience on VA.gov to better inform practices for sign-in and inherited proofing.

With the Unified Sign In page, and the rollout of Login.gov in 2022, we will start transitioning users to their choice of Login.gov or ID.me. We need UI/UX research and design to help develop a seamless experience for users to be informed of the change and easily choose a new credential.

MHV users will soon be directed to VA.gov with a new design informing them that they will need to choose a new credential for signing to access products and services, that will potentially include the need to identity proof again, or for certain ineligible users, the ability to have an inherited proofing status with their account . Creating an easily navigable experience is crucial. This experience when signed in through ID.me, MHV, or DS Logon through VA.gov will be new for all users that are anticipated to be part of the research. For users that have been to VA.gov, the design is built with similar patterns, designs, and experiences that already exist on VA.gov.

### OCTO Objectives

>Which [OCTO objectives] (https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme) does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.

6. Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

- Veterans can manage their account to a consolidated login
- Veterans can decide the best CSP for their needs
- Veterans and their families can apply for all benefits online
- Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information

_All of the above are dependent on an easy and secure sign-in experience_

### Veteran Journey
>Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)?<br>Are there moments that matter?

Our product fits in at the start of the Veteran Journey from Serving in the Military through Getting Out and Starting Up.  However, it additionally serves the Veteran throughout their journey because they may receive VA services throughout their life.

Starting Up
- Finding something to do
- Re-establishing and creating relationships
- Attending to health needs


Our product fits into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) at the Starting Up of myself Life Stage. At this moment a veteran is looking to find help and support for their health.

Taking care of self
- Managing primary care and chronic health issues
- Maintaining my health
- Seeking support for an acute health event

## Research Goals    
>What are you trying to learn from this research?

Our goal is to create a simple experience for users to go through inherited proofing. Specifically, the goal of this study is to discover any pain points.

### Outcome
>How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?

- This research will inform design, content, or functionality changes needed to increase accessibility on VA.gov and to address any pain points with the flow of the inherited proofing process.

- Learnings will be incorporated into future design, content, and functionality and shared with other teams to inform modal considerations of other products and services

- The results will also be used to inform subsequent rounds of user research and testing.

### Research questions

1. What sort of pain points are not addressed before sign-in?
2. Is the “Transition” modal disruptive to the user’s task?
3. How long does it take for users to complete the transition process?
4. What technical issues are they encountering?
5. What tasks do they typically log in for?
6. Is the Wizard informative and usable?
7. What information is most useful, least useful, or missing?
8. Will a user continue their task on VA.gov or create a new login?
9. How often do veterans read the notifications?
10. What other ways veterans would like to be notified?
11. Are veterans consenting to let their information be shared?
12. What questions or concerns do they have about sharing their information?
13. What forms of identifications do Veterans have?


### Hypothesis
>What do you intend to learn and measure from this study? Think through these prompts to develop a strong hypothesis.

We believe that existing VA users, who are ineligible, will be able to transition to Login.gov or ID.Me, once they have completed the identity verification/proofing process.

We believe that using a wizard will help the overall experience of choosing their new login.

## Method    
>Describe the method you’re planning. You should be able to explain why this method is appropriate for the goals of the research and the maturity of the design.

Remote moderated usability test via the application that can satisfy our criteria:
- Being able to record the session
- Being able to record the user's screen

Our goals include:
- Discover how users would navigate the inherited proofing content page
- Discover any inconsistencies regarding a users' journey for consenting information

>What method of research are you planning to use?
Remote, semi-moderated sessions
- We will need to use a video conferencing tool that allows users to record and share their screen(s) while using a low-fidelity prototype.

>Why this method? How does this help you answer your research questions?
- We can see how users navigate.
- We can see where users are having difficulty in different areas of the inherited proofing experience.

### Location
>Where will you be holding the research sessions? Be sure to include whether this is remote or in-person research. [Learn more about setting up in-person research.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/planning-in-person-research.md)

>If remote, include your preferred video conferencing software. Choice of: Zoom, GoTo Meeting; WebEx.

- Location: Remote (online)
- Point of contact: Samuel Vang (svang@clarityinnovates.com)
- Equipment used for research: Zoom or Webex

## Previous research

- This research study was conducted to understand the Veteran sign-in experience on VA websites and gauge first impressions of Login.gov, a new credential provider.  [VA.gov Login process, August 2021](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/login.gov/Login.gov-research-plan.md)

- This research study was conducted in a two-part unmoderated study. Using a card sort Participants were asked to rank attributes of credential providers from most important to least important. In a first-click study, participants were tasked with logging in to see if they were able to easily locate their CSP with the new design changes  [Sign-in redesign and provider attributes, October 2021](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/login.gov/signin-provider-research-plan.md)
