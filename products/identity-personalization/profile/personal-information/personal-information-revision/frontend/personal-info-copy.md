### Field Set
- Per a11y feedback in design intent review, the fieldset div **should not** contain a gray header with "Personal information" because it causes screen readers to read aloud "Personal information" twice, which may be confusing.

### Field Labels and Content 

Each div within the form field set will contain:
  - Field label
  - Current value of the field retrieved from the MPI database.  Values shown below are samples that correspond with the mockups.
  - Edit button (if editable)

**Date of birth** 
July 16, 1957
