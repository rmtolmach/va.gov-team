## Research Goals
In order to support Veterans in the Starting Up and Taking Care of Myself phases of the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf), we need to define a strategy for how to move forward with rolling the My HealtheVet (MHV) profile into the VA.gov profile. 

In order to do this, we conducted research to better understand:
1. The similarities and differences between the My HealtheVet and VA.gov profiles.
2. The current status of MHV profile work and transition planning.
3. How MHV support roles (coordinators and help desk) use the MHV profile.
4. How MHV users use the profile.

## Research Questions
* How does the data in the MHV profile align with the data in the VA.gov profile?
* What data needs to be added to the VA.gov profile in order to support MHV users?
* Are there other sections of the “Personal Information” section of MHV that we need to account for in the profile?
* Will we need to support the MHV credential after the health apartment transition?
* What work has already been done by other teams (health apartment, MHV) to prepare for this transition?
* What else should we consider as we think about how the VA.gov profile might change as it needs to support MHV users?
* Are there analytics available that can help us understand how the personal information section is useful to MHV users?
* What does the MHV profile team know about how their users use the profile?
* How do MHV support staff use data from the profile and personal information section?
* What expectations do stakeholders have around the MHV —> VA.gov profile transition?
* How do MHV users use their profiles and the other sections under Personal Information in MHV?
* How can we make this transition less painful for them?

## Methodology 
We used a variety of research methods to answer our research questions:
1. Comparative analysis to understand the differences between the MHV and VA.gov profiles. 
2. Data analysis to gain insights into user behavior and profile completeness.
3. Semi-structured interviews with MHV stakeholders, VA.gov stakeholders, and MHV users.
4. A moderated card sort with MHV users.
