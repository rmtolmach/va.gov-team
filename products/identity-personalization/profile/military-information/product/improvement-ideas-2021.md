### [Top searched terms overall on VA.gov related to military history between 10.11.2020 and 10.17.21](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/report/content-site-search-search-terms/a50123418w177519031p176188361/_u.date00=20201011&_u.date01=20211017&explorer-table.plotKeys=%5B%5D&explorer-table.rowStart=0&explorer-table.rowCount=50/)

**DD214 (52,833 unique searches)**

- On the modernized site, this is [largely searched from the main search bar](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/report/content-site-search-search-terms/a50123418w177519031p184624291/_u.date00=20201011&_u.date01=20211017&explorer-table.plotKeys=%5B%5D&_r.drilldown=analytics.searchKeyword:dd214/). Not sure if there is anything we can do to help with this since it's already featured on the homepage in the Records box.
- This is also a popular search in the find forms tool, where DD214 is not explicility called out.
- [On all VA.gov properties](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/report/content-site-search-search-terms/a50123418w177519031p176188361/_u.date00=20201011&_u.date01=20211017&explorer-table.plotKeys=%5B%5D&explorer-table.rowStart=0&explorer-table.rowCount=50&_r.drilldown=analytics.searchKeyword:dd214/), this seems to also be popular on MHV, so people must need their DD214 for health care business.

## Requests

### Enhanced statement of service

- Proposed by George Chewning
- Questions:
  -  What military information would be helpful to have on VA.gov that would support veterans' abilities to receive and manage benefits?
  -  What military data would it be helpful to have on VA.gov to support predictive benefit eligibility? 
- We also discussed a possible research engagement to talk about what military information veterans need most on VA.gov

## Potential efforts

### Research engagements

-  How do people use/when do people need their DD214 when interacting with the VA?
-  Are there certain pieces of information from the DD214 it would be especially helpful to reflect on VA.gov that we don't support now (eg. discharge status)?
-  What military data would it be helpful to have on VA.gov to support predictive benefit eligibility? 

### Small improvements we could do now

- Link to the site where veterans can access their DD214 from the profile.
