# Creating new content in the VA.gov Veteran benefit experience

## Step 1: Determine if and where your content belongs in the Veteran benefit experience

Use our content placement criteria to determine if your content belongs in the Veteran benefit content experience. 

If the content you're evaluating has multiple pieces to it, use the criteria to evaluate each piece of content on its own.

<details>
 <summary>Read an example</summary>
 
 **For example:** If you're evaluating a page that contains eligibility criteria for a VA benefit as well as related questions and answers about eligibility, evaluate the eligibility criteria and each Q&A separately.
 </details>

### Criteria 1: Does your content meet both of these requirements?
- [ ] Content speaks directly to Veterans, service members, or family members, **and**
- [ ] Content directly supports a Veteran, service member, or family member in discovering, applying for, tracking, managing, or using a VA benefit or service

#### What do to next based on your answer:

- **If no,** your content doesn't belong in the Veteran benefit experience. Your content may belong somewhere else within the VA content ecosystem. Contact the VA.gov content team for guidance.
- **If yes,** your content belongs in the Veteran benefit experience. Use this additional content criteria question to determine if your content's primary home should be a VA.gov benefit hub or the VA.gov Resources and Support section.

### Criteria 2: Does your content meet both of these requirements?

- [ ] A Veteran, service member, or family member must submit an application to receive the specific benefit that the content supports.

 <summary>Read examples</summary>
 
  - **Example 1:** A Veteran must submit an application to get VA health care. They do not, however, need to submit an application to get mental health care or vision care specifically because those are provided as part of the VA health care medical benefits package. Based on this, you would answer "Yes" for VA health care, but "No" for mental health care or vision care.
  - **Example 2:** A Veteran must submit an application to get Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits. If the Veteran then wants to extend those benefits through the Edith Nourse Rogers STEM Scholarship, they must submit another  application specifically for the scholarship. Based on this, you would answer "Yes" for both content about the Post 9/11 GI Bill benefits and content about the Edith Nourse Rogers STEM Scholarship.
 </details>

**And** content provides an overview with basic, high-level information about one of these topics:
- [ ] What the person gets with the benefit (including current compensation rates), **or**
- [ ] Top-level benefit eligibility, **or**
- [ ] Instructions on how to apply

**Note:** At this time, benefit hubs also include landing pages for authenticated tools that help a Veteran, service member, or family member manage their VA health care, benefits, and personal information. If your content supports a tool directly tied to managing VA health care, benefits, or personal information, contact the VA.gov content team. 

<details>
 <summary>Read examples</summary>
 
  - **Example 1:** You would answer "Yes" for a bulleted list of the different types of evidence a Veteran needs to apply for a benefit. You would answer "No" for detailed information about each of the different types of evidence and how to gather that information.
  - **Example 2:** You would answer "Yes" for a bulleted list of the different types of presumed disabilities that make a Veteran eligible for VA disability compensation. You would answer "No" for detailed information about each type of presumed disability.
  - **Example 3:** You would answer "Yes" for a summary description of what a Veteran receives through a benefit program, such as the Post-9/11 GI Bill. You would answer "No" for detailed information about the many different ways a Veteran can use their Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits.
</details>

#### What to do next based on your answer:

- **If yes,** your content's primary home should be in a VA.gov benefit hub. Contact the VA.gov content team.
- **If no,** your content's primary home may be in Resources and Support. Answer the next question to make sure.

### Criteria 3: Does your content meet at least one of these goals?

- [ ] Provides supplemental eligibility, evidence information, or application instructions for a benefit, **or**
- [ ] Explains ways to use a VA benefit,**or**
- [ ] Provides more information about a specific program, service, or sub-benefit that a person can use after they apply for a VA benefit, **or**
- [ ] Provides a brief overview and link to more information about a Veteran benefit from another government agency (like DoD), **or**
- [ ] Provides support for signing into and using VA.gov, **or**
- [ ] Answers a question that Veterans, service members, or family members have about VA benefits and services (based on contact center reports, search data, and user feedback)

#### What to do next based on your answer:

- **If yes,** your content's primary home should be in Resources and Support. Move to **Step 2** in this process.
- **If no,** contact the VA.gov content team to discuss more about where your content should live.

## Step 2: Make sure your content is unique

Search the [Resources and Support article list](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/sitewide-content/resources-and-support/resources-and-support-article-list.md) to make sure there isn't already content on this topic. If there is existing content that is identical or similar to the content you'd like to propose, review the content. If you'd like to propose changes or additions to the content, contact the VA.gov content team.

## Step 3: Choose your template

Before you write content for Resources and Support, you'll need to choose a template. Some Resources and Support templates offer more flexibility, while others have a limited number of components to choose from and stricter character counts. Following the template from the start will help you avoid needing to go back and rewrite content to fit the template when you go into Drupal to build the content.

Resources and Support offers these templates:

- **Step-by-step template:** Choose this template if your content describes a process that has a series of steps that must happen in order.
- **Checklist template:** Choose this template if your content describes a collection of items that the person must have or gather, or a collection of steps that don't need to occur in order.
- **About template:** Choose this template if your content will provide Veterans or other beneficiaries information that fits together in a cohesive flow. _Add more guidance on About templates_
- **Single Q&As and multiple FAQs:** [Read our guidance on FAQs](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/content-patterns-and-standards/faqs.md)
- **Media list:** Choose this template if you need to provide a collection of images on a related topic.
- **Video list:** Choose this template if you need to provide a collection of videos on a related topic. 

## Step 4: Determine your H1 page header

Here's how to determine your H1:
- Do your search engine optimization (SEO) research and/or check contact center data. Try to include a keyword or phrase that people are using to talk about this topic in your H1.
- Do a search on VA.gov using your proposed H1. This will help you double check that there isn't already existing or similar content. 
- Follow the VA.gov content style guide guidance for H1s.

## Step 4: Submit your Resources and Support content intake form

_Need simple form + instructions_

## Step 5: Create your content

[Use the content checklist for guidance](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/sitewide-content/checklists/content-checklist.md)

## Step 6: Send your draft content for a plain language review

Get a plain language review before you send content out for SME review. This helps to avoid having SMEs review content multiple times.

To request a review, send your content to 

**Turnaround time:** 5 business days

## Step 7: Send your draft content for SME review

Depending on your workflow, send either the Word doc template of your article or a preview link of the content in its final presentation, or both. It's often helpful to send the preview link to help SMEs visualize how the content will actually appear to site visitors. Ask SMEs to review the content for accuracy only. If SMEs have questions about plain language edits, please feel free to contact the VA.gov content team for support. Content on VA.gov needs to meet both SME accuracy approval and VA.gov content standards for plain language, style, and voice.

## Step 8: Submit your content for final pre-publication review

Send these 2 items to the VA.gov content team:
- A link to the preview article
- A note about your results from the [content checklist](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/sitewide-content/checklists/content-checklist.md). If you have questions related to the content checklist, include these when you send the content.

The VA.gov content team will review the article against the checklist. We'll contact you to set up time to go over any questions or concerns.

**Turnaround time:** 3 days

## Step 9: Send a preview of the content to SMEs for awareness and final sign off

SMEs should always have the opportunity to review content in its final form for awareness. Send a preview link of the content to SMEs. Provide the date for receiving final sign off and any questions or concerns about content. If SMEs have questions about plain language edits, please feel free to contact the VA.gov content team for support.

## Step 10: Publish content and add it to the article list

Once the date has passed for sign-off, or earlier if you have sign-off from SMEs, publish your article. Then add the article to the [Resources and Support article list](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/sitewide-content/resources-and-support/resources-and-support-article-list.md).
