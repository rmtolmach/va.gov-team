# Conversation Guide: St. Louis Visit to Gather Feedback on Pilot from Staff

## Upon arriving at the site, take notes about the setup of the clinic. 
_Particularly important for the locations that we haven't visited yet._
- What type of care is provided?
- What does the area look like?
- How many MSAs/clerks are available in the clinic?
- What is the staff check-in process like?
- How is cellular service?

## Intro
Hello. My name is [name] and I'm a researcher on the patient check-in team. Our research team is interested in understanding how the new pre-check-in and check-in processes have been working at your clinic and their impact on your job. We are also looking for feedback on a couple of future features. As a result, I would like to observe you checking in Veterans and ask you a few questions if that is alright?

If no, ask if there is a better time to meet with them. Otherwise, **[end session.]**

If yes, continue...

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **We want to hear your honest opinions.** We just want to improve check-in to better meet Veteran's and your needs. I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to pause or stop, just let me know.** 

## Pilot Feedback Questions
- Things to watch for while observing staff:
  - Did they still engage and talk to Veterans who completed check-in on VA.gov?
    - Why?
  - What does the handoff from MSA to the provider look like? (We are looking to understand the impact of the VSE GUI change to the handoff process.)

### Pre-check-in
- How has pre-check-in impacted checking in on the day the appointment? _Explain what pre-check-in is if need be._
- How has it impacted your work?
- How has it impacted the Veteran experience?
  - Have Veterans reported any specific pre-check-in feedback to you? If so, what was their feedback?
- Overall, what do you like about pre-check-in? What do Veterans like about it?
- What do you dislike about it? What do Veterans dislike about it?
- On a scale from 0 to 10 (0 = Not at all likely AND 10 = Extremely likely), how likely is it that you would recommend this pre-check-in process be utilized at another VA clinic?

### Patient Check-in (Day of check-in)
- How has mobile check-in impacted your work?
  - Have you had to engage with or talk to Veterans who utilized mobile check-in before their appointment? If so, why?
  - How would you describe the impact of the changes to VSE-GUI (due to mobile check-in) on your work?
    - How often do you review the different check-in statuses within VSE-GUI? 
      - Are there any check-in statuses that you find more valuable to review than others?
  - Did you have to change anything else about your workflow to accommodate this new process?
    - How has mobile check-in affected communication between MSAs and providers?
      - _Probe more into the handoff/patient tracking process if necessary._
  - _For MSA Supervisors:_ How has this mobile check-in process affected your supervisory duties and how you balance your team?
- How has mobile check-in impacted the Veteran experience? 
  - Has it affected complaints about long waits/Veterans in the waiting room who have not actually been checked in?
  - Have Veterans reported any specific mobile check-in feedback to you? If so, what was their feedback?
    - How quickly have Veterans been receiving the check-in link after texting "checkin?"
- Overall, what do you like about mobile check-in? 
- What do you dislike about it?
- On a scale from 0 to 10 (0 = Not at all likely AND 10 = Extremely likely), how likely is it that you would recommend this mobile phone check-in process be utilized at another VA clinic?
- What would you change about the new mobile check-in?

## Telemedicine Appointments (Telephone)
As we look toward future development, we would like to understand telemedicine appointments more, particularly telephone appointments.
- Do providers at this location utilize telephone appointments within their practice?
  - What type of appointments, such as follow-ups, are telephone appointments utilized? 
- What is the current pre-registration process (review of address, emergency contact, and insurance) for telephone appointments? 
  - How is the process similar or different for other telemedicine appointment types?
- Are you experiencing any challenges with telephone appointments? If so, what are they?
  - Are there similar or different challenges with other types of telemedicine appointments?
- What is your ideal way to get pre-registration information from Veterans who have a telephone appointment? 
  - What about for other types of telemedicine appointments?

## Patient Record Flags 
(Some of these questions might be for more administrators at the sites. MSAs might not have the answers to all of these questions.)

We would also like to get your input on the use and value of patient record flags, such as a behavioral flag.
- How do you currently use patient record flags, if at all? 
- Where do you see the flag, and how do you respond?
- Do you use national or local flags, or both?
- If patient record flags were added to VSE for Clinical Staff, where/when would you want to see them? 
- Would you want only behavioral flags, or all patient flags?
- Is there any other patient information you would want to be alerted to that isn't already in VSE for Clinical Staff?

## Appointment Notifications
_Some of these questions might already be answered by questions within the pre-check-in or check-in sections. If you don't have enough time with a staff member, then the questions in bold are the priority questions._

**For our last topic, we would like to learn more about how you communicate with Veterans about their appointments (telemedicine and in-person). We know that facilities want to keep Veterans up-to-date about when an appointment is confirmed, canceled, or changed.**
- **What tools or methods do you use to keep Veterans up-to-date about their appointments?**
- **What challenges do you run into with using or managing these?**

Additionally, we know facilities will capture health information from Veterans before an appointment, or let them check-in for an appointment. 
- How do you currently capture current health information before an appointment?
  - If needed, prompt
    - Current medications
    - Current symptoms
- What challenges do you run into when capturing health information before check-in?

Thinking about all the tools and methods you use to keep Veterans up-to-date about their appointments:
- You mentioned these earlier: [list some tools and methods they already talked about] 
  - Are there others that you haven’t mentioned yet?
    - If needed, prompt:
      - Postcards? Letters
      - VEText appointment reminders?
      - Audiocare robocalls?
- You mentioned some challenges using these tools: [list some challenges they already mentioned]
  - Are there any other challenges you haven’t mentioned?

## Thank you
We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us, so we can continue to improve Veteran and your experience. 

Finally, we’re looking to deepen our understanding of Veteran notifications. This takes a bit longer, but in the end gives us a much deeper view of all these different systems.
- We’re hoping to make this exercise beneficial to your team too, and would share the outcome afterwards.
- This would build on our starting conversation here.
- If this is something you would be interested in, let me know and I’ll send along details of what we would need.

I hope you enjoy the rest of your day!
