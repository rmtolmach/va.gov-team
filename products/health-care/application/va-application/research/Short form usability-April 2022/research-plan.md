# [DRAFT] Research Plan: VSA 10-10, Usability research of shortened form based on disability rating, Health Care application 10-10EZ, April 2022

## Background
This research is to be conducted on the Health Care Application (10-10EZ) by the VSA 10-10 team.

Based on our [Google Analytics](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HDGBx-whUrSArDLf8OP_-65lCMPi36h0ihHPA3XqmIk/edit#slide=id.p1) data and [Discovery research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/10-10EZ/Research%20April-May%202021/End%20user%20discovery%20research/research%20findings.md) we have identified that the Military Service and Household Information sections of the 10-10EZ cause applicants the most confusion, time, and show the highest drop-off rates. As part of an iterative process we have created [shortened form flows](https://www.sketch.com/s/da85cf44-4503-4e98-834e-ff068b242ef6/p/A71F1C96-FF98-42A2-9ADD-6D4B7A1DDB20) that eliminate these two sections for those that we identify to have a service-connected disability rating of 50% or higher either through information we already have on file (pre-populated) or by the applicant self-reporting it during the application. In the future, we will look into expanding this short form experience for other qualifying questions.

In September 2021 prototype [usability research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/10-10EZ/Short%20form%20flow%20research/Research%20findings.md) validated the flows that are now in production. The primary purpose of this research is to test the designs/flows in production and reach participant populations that we were unable to reach due to prototype limitations. Additionally A/B testing will be conducted on the two design options for the self-report confirmation screen as collab cycle as suggested that Design B is more in alignment with the design system. 

## Goals	

The goals of this user research are to:
1. Determine whether or not the short form flow is usable and understandable when it is pre-populated at start of authenticated application
2. Determine whether or not the short form flow is usable and understandable understood when it is based on a self-reported, service-connected disability pay for a 50% or higher rating with "Design A" in production
3. Determine whether or not the short form flow is usable and understandable understood when it is based on a self-reported, service-connected disability pay for a 50% or higher rating with "Design B" in staging (note: this page will need to be developed for testing)
4. Determine whether or not the flow and copy set proper expectations for the application experience


**Research questions**

1. Are users able to navigate through the pre-populated short form easily and without confusion?
2. Are users able to navigate through the short form based on self-reported information easily and without confusion?
3. How does Design A vs. B perform (usability, comprehension, confusion, blockers)?
4. Does the green expandable alert cause annoyance or feel repetitive? 
5. Do users understand what the short form is?
6. Do users understand why they can fill out a short form?
7. What is the overall sentiment about this short form experience?


**Hypothesis**

Our hypothesis is that users will be able to navigate through the short form relatively easily, but may have issues with the following:

On authenticated initial alert screen (with place of birth field):
- Participants might miss the alert

On self-report confirmation screen:
- Design A or B will may bring up questions of why participant has to confirm
- Participants might just click through without reading
- Participants might find that using the "Back" button to change their selection (if wrong) is confusing

Green expandable alert on every page of short form:
- Some users might overlook the alert 
- Some user might find it annoying that it's repetitive on every page 


## Method	
**Task analysis**

A task-based usability study will be conducted remotely with Zoom using the Perigean contract. A remote moderator will begin with introduction questions and prompt users with guiding questions (from the [conversation guide]. Participants will be shown one of three flows:
1. Short form based on pre-populated disability rating of 50% or higher at application start 
2. Short form based on self-reported disability rating of 50% or higher on VA compensation question - Design A
3. Short form based on self-reported disability rating of 50% or higher on VA compensation question - Design B


Participants will be encouraged to talk through their exploration of the flow. Remote observers and note takers will be in attendance.

We will be testing in staging.
  	

## Participants and Recruitment	
We would like to work with Perigean to recruit for 13 fulfilled remote sessions. Therefore, we request that 18 sessions be scheduled.

**Must have for participants**

- At least 10 Veterans
- At least 2 Power of attorney (POA) but no more than 3
- At least 11 people with a disability rating of 50% or higher 
     - At least 3 people who use a screenreader (at least 1 that is new to assistive technology)
     - At least 5 people with a cognitive disability
- At least 8 people who will use a mobile device during the research session

**Demographic makeup**
- At least 50% that identify as women or nonbinary
- At least 50% age 55+
- At least 50% that live in a rural area
- At least 50% that don't have a bachelor degree or higher
- At least 2 participants who identify as Black or African American
- At least 3 participants who identify as Hispanic
- At least 2 participants who identify as Asian
- At least 2 participants who identify as Native
- All participants must be able to use Zoom, locate and use the chat function in Zoom, and to share their screen through Zoom



**Participant pool should in diverse in**
